# Python vs. Go: Explore the differences
Python is the language to use for readable, shareable code—hence the large community around it. Go is an open-source programming language developed by Google which statically-typed compiled language. What do you know about them? Which one is good for your project?

When you decide to start a new coding project, it's so important to choose a suitable programming language first and then start your project.
In the following you can explore the differences, similarities, and use cases for Python and Go, two of the most popular programming languages in the world.

## [The Python Programming Language](https://www.python.org)
Python is a high-level object-oriented programming language. It has built-in data structures, combined with dynamic binding and typing, which makes it an ideal choice for rapid application development. 
Python also offers support for modules and packages, which allows system modularity and code reuse. It is one of the fastest programming language as it requires very few lines of code. 
Its emphasis is on readability and simplicity, which make it a great choice for beginners.

### Python code example:
In the program below, we take a temperature in degree Celsius and convert it into degree Fahrenheit. They are related by the formula:

``` C
hfahrenheit = celsius * 1.8 + 32
```

**Source Code:**

``` C
# Python Program to convert temperature in celsius to fahrenheit

# change this value for a different result
celsius = 37.5

# calculate fahrenheit
fahrenheit = (celsius * 1.8) + 32
print('%0.1f degree Celsius is equal to %0.1f degree Fahrenheit' %(celsius,fahrenheit))
```

**Output:**

``` C
37.5 degree Celsius is equal to 99.5 degree Fahrenheit
```

We encourage you to create a Python program to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius on your own using the following formula:

``` C
celsius = (fahrenheit - 32) / 1.8
```

## [The Go Programming Language](https://go.dev)
Short for Golang, Go was first designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson in 2007. Go is an open-source programming and a statically-typed compiled language. 
This language support concurrent programming and also allows running multiple processes simultaneously. This is achieved using channels, goroutines, etc. 
Go has garbage collection, which itself does the memory management and allows the deferred execution of functions.

### Go code example:
In this program, we will read the temperature value in Celsius and convert it into Fahrenheit and print the result on the console screen.

**Source Code:**

``` C
//Golang program to convert the Celsius to Fahrenheit.

package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    var ftemp float64=0
    var ctemp float64=0
    
    fmt.Printf("Enter temperature in Celsius: ");
    fmt.Scanf("%f",&ctemp);
    ftemp= (ctemp*1.8)+32;
    fmt.Printf("Temperature in Fahrenheit: %.2f",ftemp);
}
```

**Output:**

``` C
Enter temperature in Celsius: 39.22
Temperature in Fahrenheit: 102.60
```

## Python and Go Comparison
Technically, Go is a procedural, functional language built for speed, and Python is an object-oriented, imperative, functional, and procedural language.
Go supports concurrency, the ability of an algorithm to run its steps out of order, and Python doesn’t.
In short, if you are working with data and your audience is people, use Python. If you are working with servers, use Go.

Below is the list of points; describe the comparison Between Python and Go.

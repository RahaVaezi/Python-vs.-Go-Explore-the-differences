# Python vs. Go: Explore the differences
Python is the language to use for readable, shareable codeâ€”hence the large community around it. Go is an open-source programming language developed by Google which statically-typed compiled language. What do you know about them? Which one is good for your project?

When you decide to start a new coding project, it's so important to choose a suitable programming language first and then start your project.
In the following you can explore the differences, similarities, and use cases for Python and Go, two of the most popular programming languages in the world.

## [The Python Programming Language](https://www.python.org)
Python is a high-level object-oriented programming language. It has built-in data structures, combined with dynamic binding and typing, which makes it an ideal choice for rapid application development. 
Python also offers support for modules and packages, which allows system modularity and code reuse. It is one of the fastest programming language as it requires very few lines of code. 
Its emphasis is on readability and simplicity, which make it a great choice for beginners.

### Python code example:
In the program below, we take a temperature in degree Celsius and convert it into degree Fahrenheit. They are related by the formula:

``` C
hfahrenheit = celsius * 1.8 + 32
```

**Source Code:**

``` C
# Python Program to convert temperature in celsius to fahrenheit

# change this value for a different result
celsius = 37.5

# calculate fahrenheit
fahrenheit = (celsius * 1.8) + 32
print('%0.1f degree Celsius is equal to %0.1f degree Fahrenheit' %(celsius,fahrenheit))
```
